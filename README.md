# What's this?

This is a simple refactoring exercise that is meant to teach something about dependency inversion and dependency injection.

## How to run tests

`./gradlew test`

## How to start

Run all the tests.  One test will fail.  Change production code so that all tests pass.

## How to continue

Refactor the code as well as you can in order to separate responsibilities.
Follow these principles:
* Open Close Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle
